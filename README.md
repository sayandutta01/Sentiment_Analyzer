Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This is a sentiment analysis project using Natural Language Processing to extract core sentiment from a text. The main sentiments are categorized into three categories:
1: Positive.
2: Negative.
3:Neutral.
It also does polarity  analysis of the text, to show how much the text is falling under the sentiment category(positive,ngative or neutral) and it also does the  subjectivity analysis of the text to check how much the text is subjective means how much the text is opiniated this can help in many way.Ex : we are analyzying a reveiew of a product so we can check the text is very much opiniated or not.

and it finaly goes one step further to do emotion analysis of the text to check how much the main emotions are present in what ratio in the text.

It is offering good graphical result of the text to analyze the text in a better way.

It is using various pacakages and libraries to these works.

2.TextBlob
3.Nrclex.

It first doing some preproccesing on the raw text data such as:
1.Tokenizing
2. stopwords removing.
3. stemming etc.

after doing these steps it does the analysis using variuos pacakages provide good analysis result  refer to the code for better understanding.
